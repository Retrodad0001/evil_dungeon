# Evil Dungeon

A 2d dungeon crawler made with the Bevy Engine in Rust. 

I created this game to learn more about the Bevy Engine and the Rust language. It may also be helpful to someone else.


There are many ways to implement the design; context is essential, like performance or maintainability constraints.

My goals are:

- Have discussions with the community about ECS vs OO design and the trade-offs in the context of maintainability

- Try to keep the complexity of the code to a minimum and only increase the complexity (like extra abstractions or generic types) when the need arises for the sake of performance or extensibility.

- Use as much Bevy as possible instead of external crates.

- I want to learn how to maximize automatic testing with Bevy because I want to reuse this knowledge in a bigger-scale game and learn about testing in Rust. (including performance testing)

- It must be a polished game, not just a tech demo, so I can learn to polish and deploy it to Steam.
