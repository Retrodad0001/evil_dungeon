# Evil Dungeon

An 2d dungeon crawler made with the Bevy Engine in Rust.
I created this game to learn more about the Bevy Engine and the Rust language. Maybe it will be useful for someone else too.

There are many ways to implement the design, context is important like performance constraints. In my case maybe OO way of design was better or using another engine or framework?

My sub goals are:
- have some discussions with the community about ECS designing and the trade-offs in de context of maintainability
- keep the complexity of the code to an minimum and only increase the complexity (like extra abstractions) when the need arises for the sake of performance or extensibility
-use as much as possible bevy instead of external crates. Exceptions are crates that fill in the gab or functionality. 
- I want to learn more about the trade off between maintainability ECS vs OO (or maybe there is sweet spot between the two?)
- I like the rust tooling, I want to learn (even when its not needed for the game) how to maximize automatic testing, so I can learn what is possible or not and reuse that logic in the future with an bigger game.
-want to learn but also provide knowledge to the community and maybe have some good discussions.
-it must be polished and not a tech demo alone, so I can learn to polish with bevy and the ECS paradigm.
