# Evil Dungeon

A 2d dungeon crawler made with the Bevy Engine in Rust. 

I created this game to learn more about the Bevy Engine and the Rust language. Maybe it will be useful for someone else too.


There are many ways to implement the design, context is important like performance or maintainability constraints.

My goals are:

- Have discussions with the community about ECS design and the trade-offs in the context of maintainability

- Try to keep the complexity of the code to a minimum and only increase the complexity (like extra abstractions or generic crates) when the need arises for the sake of performance or extensibility.

- Use as much as possible bevy instead of external crates. Exceptions are crates that fill in the functionality gab.

- I want to learn more about the trade-off between maintainability ECS vs. OO (maybe I will find the sweet spot between the two?)

- I like the rust tooling, I want to learn (even when it's not needed for the game) how to maximize automatic testing (unit and integration), so I can learn what is possible or not and reuse that Knowledge when creating another “real” game.

- It must be polished and not a tech demo alone, so I can learn to polish with bevy and the ECS paradigm.
